# chess_rust

## Objectives

This chess program is for educative purpose and a motivation to learn Rust.

## Algorithms

- Minimax (I have done negamax in fact)
- Alpha beta
- IDDFS

And there are heurstic:

- Preordering of moves
- Recapture if capture at the max depth

## TODO

- Time management
- Refactoring of the code
- Aspiration Window
- Improve speed (not a priority)
	- In this version, I think there are allocation that could be avoided
	- I should consider magic number (may be I could enhance speed by a factor of 2).

## Next steps

- Add neural networks (NNUE ?)
